Antipole Seasons
=======

Game made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 30 where the theme was "Connected Worlds".

Don't expect too much of the code. Everything had to made from scratch (code, graphics, sound) and you got to know the theme when the 48 hours started so you don't have time for contemplation.
